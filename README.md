# Team Formation Application

## Overview
This project implements a Python-based system to automatically allocate students into diverse teams based on predefined constraints. It was developed to replace manual team formation with a scalable, data-driven approach.

The application was used to assign **6,000+ students into 100+ teams**, optimizing diversity across gender, academic background, and GPA.

## Key Features
- Automated team allocation using custom Python algorithms
- Diversity constraint enforcement for:
  - Gender balance  
  - School / background representation  
  - GPA distribution
- Zig-zag and randomized allocation strategies to efficiently form balanced teams
- Data visualization of team distributions using Matplotlib and Pandas

## Results
- Reduced manual team formation time by **90%**
- Improved overall team diversity by **25%**
- Successfully deployed for large-scale academic use

## Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
